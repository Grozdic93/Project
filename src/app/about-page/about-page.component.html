              <br>
              Born in Russia (probably between 1909 and 1914 although she kept her age a secret), Leen studied painting in Berlin.<br>Before she emigrated to<br> the United States in 1939, she had also lived in Italy and Switzerland.[6] Her first photographs to be published in Life in April 1940 were of tortoises at the Bronx Zoo, taken with her Rolleiflex camera. While she never became a staff photographer at Life, she contributed as a contract<br> photographer until the magazine closed in 1972.[5] Leen was a prolific photographer of fashion for Life, and was long married to the fashion photographer Serge Balkin.[1] She was recognised<br> with inclusion by Edward Steichen of two of her photographs in The Family of Man international <br>touring exhibition; one a photograph of a child at a blackboard, the other, several generations of an Ozark farming family (later selected by Carl Sagan for the 12 inch Voyager golden <br>records).
              <br>
              Over the years, Leen was behind over 50 magazine covers and contributed countless reports from around the world, including the story of her dog Lucky which<br> began in 1949 and later led to a book. In addition to her many animal stories, she is remembered for covering young people <br> in the 1940s and 1950s and the group of artists known as The Irascibles.<br> She also documented European royalty, fashion models, dance, and actresses. From 1973, Leen<br> avidly continued to publish her work in book form, including her notable images of bats which she called her flying kittens.
